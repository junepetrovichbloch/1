    <h2>October 30, 2025</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added this dedicated <strong>Site Changelog</strong> page for transparency and recordkeeping.</li>
      <li>Converted the entire website from a dark theme to a light theme to improve readability and reduce visual strain.</li>
      <li>Fixed several <strong>broken document links</strong> within the filings table, including:
        <ul>
          <li><em>October 6, 2025 – Lis Pendens</em> filed with the Property Records Division.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Reworked the <strong>Confidential Access Overlay</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Moved the large fixed confidential notice banner off the main page and integrated it into the password access overlay for better layout balance.</li>
          <li>Redesigned the login interface with improved styling, readability, and contact options.</li>
          <li>Added a <strong>Contact Site Admin</strong> button on the access screen, allowing users to reach the administrator directly if access issues occur.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Replaced the fixed banner text at the top of the main page with a simplified link to this changelog for reference.</li>
      <li>Updated section formatting and readability improvements throughout (spacing, typography, and contrast adjustments).</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Optional before/after text comparison block -->
    <h3>Text Update Reference:</h3> 
    <ul>
      <li>SECTION: <i>Summary of Dispute and Allegations</i></li>
      <li>PARAGRAPH: <i>Seperate materials address caregiving...</i></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Before:</strong>
      <p>Separate materials address caregiving and medical conditions in my aunt’s final period. They describe an absence of appropriate dementia care, infection-control practices, and professional support, alongside admissions by the caregivers that basic hygiene and in-home care were not being maintained. The medical sequence culminating in recurrent C. difficile, sepsis, and hospital-acquired pneumonia is connected to those conditions and offered as evidence of medical neglect. This dimension matters because it shows motive, opportunity, and the functional dependence that made legal “consents” impossible in reality.</p>

      <strong>After:</strong>
      <p>Separate materials address caregiving and medical conditions in my aunt’s final period. They describe an absence of appropriate dementia care, infection-control practices, and professional support, alongside admissions that essential caregivers were not reasonably employed to provide basic hygiene and in-home care<strong>, which</strong> were not being maintained based on the septic nature of the recurring infections that ultimately resulted in my aunt's death. The medical sequence culminating in recurrent C. difficile, sepsis, and hospital-acquired pneumonia is connected to those conditions and offered as evidence of medical neglect. This dimension matters because it shows motive, opportunity, and the functional dependence that made legal “consents” impossible in reality.</p>
