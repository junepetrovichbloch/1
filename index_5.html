      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> This webpage was prepared by <strong>Jaden Alexandra Riley</strong>, the <em>pro se contestant</em> in the matter of the <strong>Estate of June Petrovich Bloch</strong>, for the internal review and evaluation of personnel at <a href="https://www.fiduciarytrust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiduciary Trust International</a>. Its purpose is to provide an organized summary of the Travis County, Texas probate proceedings associated with the decedent’s will and related filings, as well as supporting documentation relevant to questions of authenticity and potential irregularities in signatures and documents submitted to the court.

<section id="summary-dispute">
  <h2>Summary of Dispute and Allegations</h2>

  <p>
    The materials that follow present my account of how my aunt, June Petrovich Bloch (born June Ann Petrovich), moved from long-standing physical illness into progressive cognitive impairment and complete dependency, and how that vulnerability was exploited to reengineer her estate plan and divert assets. The record I provide shows a sustained decline in judgment, memory, and executive function, accompanied by severe frailty and increasing reliance on her daughter, Lindsey Ann Bloch, and her son-in-law, Jonathan Daniel Poritsky, living next to her and controlling her daily environment. Medical descriptions, contemporaneous messages, and behavioral records describe symptoms consistent with frontotemporal dementia, alcohol-related dementia, and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, together with profound physical weakness and malnutrition, leaving her unable to understand or manage legal or financial matters. These impairments, and the degree of isolation around her, are central to everything that follows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Against that backdrop, the case documents detail a pattern of isolation, information control, and financial access by my cousin, Lindsey, who positioned herself as sole gatekeeper over my aunt’s communications, finances, and paperwork. The record describes concealed banking and deed activity, exclusion of other family members from estate information, execution of property transfers and a will that removed me entirely, and filing choices in probate that avoided transparent accounting. These are pleaded as elder financial abuse, undue influence, forgery, and executor misconduct within the probate matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Separate materials address caregiving and medical conditions in my aunt’s final period. They describe an absence of appropriate dementia care, infection-control practices, and professional support, alongside admissions that essential caregivers were not reasonably employed to provide basic hygiene and in-home care, which were clearly not being maintained based on the septic nature of the recurring infections that ultimately resulted in my aunt's death. The medical sequence culminating in recurrent C. difficile, sepsis, and hospital-acquired pneumonia is connected to those conditions and offered as evidence of medical neglect. This dimension matters because it shows motive, opportunity, and the functional dependence that made legal “consents” impossible in reality.
  </p>

  <p>
    This package is therefore not a single allegation but an integrated showing: objective capacity deficits; a closed information environment; legal instruments and real-property transactions executed during incapacity; opaque administration and personal benefit by the person now acting as proponent of the will; and caregiving failures consistent with the overall course. Each document in the website repository maps to one or more of these pillars—for example, symptom descriptions and behavioral evidence establishing incapacity; communications evidencing isolation and control; deed and loan papers; will-execution materials; and administration filings. Read together, they support the relief I seek in probate and explain why help from the trust company is both necessary and appropriate.
  </p>

  <p>
    <div class="highlight-box"><strong>RELIEF SOUGHT IN PROBATE (summary):</strong>
 set aside the will; unwind or re-title affected real-property transactions; impose a constructive trust or similar equitable remedy as needed; require full inventories, accountings, and document production; preserve assets; claim my Aunt's remains; remove and replace the current executor with a neutral fiduciary; and grant all other justice and equitable relief supported by the evidence.
    </div></p>

  <h3>What I’m asking of Fiduciary Trust International</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm whether trusts or custodial accounts exist or existed for my aunt, her former spouse, her brother, or her parents, and identify capacities (settlor, trustee, beneficiary) and applicable ranges.</li>
    <li>Specify the legal/compliance process you require (e.g., protective order, subpoena, certifications) to provide instruments, amendments, successor-trustee acceptances, asset schedules, and trustee accountings relevant to this dispute.</li>
    <li>Place appropriate administrative holds or cautions on distributions or changes, if any trust you administer could be affected by the probate outcome, and tell us what court direction you need to maintain those holds.</li>
    <li>Conduct—at your expense as warranted by your policies when client documents are alleged to be forged—independent forensic examinations of contested signatures and execution packages connected to any trust-related paperwork within your control or custody, and coordinate with the court regarding preservation and chain of custody.</li>
    <li>Coordination regarding a secure channel to receive the full repository (deeds, execution packets, messages, medical and caregiving records, probate filings) and to arrange interviews of relevant personnel if your institution or its agents appear on witnessing/notarization or account paperwork.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This introduction is intended to frame the evidence you will see: a concentrated demonstration of incapacity, undue influence, document irregularities, and harmful administration, and a concrete request for your institutional assistance to clarify trust relationships, preserve potential trust assets, and help the court reach an accurate outcome.

 I sent an administrative review packet to Attorney Albers and Notary Cross on October 21, 2025, requesting, among other materials, the notary log entry for the deed. Attorney Albers provided the log entry on October 24, 2025. The signature appearing in the notary log matches the handwriting on the contested instruments, including the 2017 will, the 2021 will, and the 2021 Special Warranty Deed, but does not match the decedent’s verified prior signatures that appear elsewhere. I informed Attorney Albers and Notary Cross that I allege the log signature to be fraudulent and the Special Warranty Deed to be unlawful.</li>

    An alleged fraudulently executed special warranty deed containing a forged signature, improperly notarized and recorded, giving the appearance of validity despite its unlawful origin. It was nonetheless acted upon to transfer ownership of real property (Lot 21, 5704 Trail Ridge Drive) on June 9, 2021; on December 27, 2021 the property was retitled into joint ownership of the Independent Executor and her spouse, Jonathan Daniel Poritsky; and on that same date a $498,000 home-equity loan was placed on the property. I filed my will contest on February 12, 2025; the house was listed for sale on or about September 7, 2025 for $1,195,000; I recorded a <i>lis pendens</i> on October 6, 2025; and the listing was removed on October 14, 2025. My February 12, 2025 filings state it is highly reasonable that the decedent lacked capacity by 2018 and certainly lacked capacity by mid-2021 to make such conveyances.
